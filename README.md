# EventHorizon ðŸŒŒ

**On-Chain Prediction Markets Beyond the Known**

EventHorizon is a decentralized prediction market platform built on the Stacks blockchain where users can create and trade outcome shares for real-world events like elections, sports, and cryptocurrency prices.

## Features

- **Market Creation**: Anyone can create prediction markets with custom duration and resolution periods
- **Advanced AMM Pricing**: Sophisticated automated market maker algorithms for optimal price discovery
- **Dynamic Liquidity**: Constant product formula ensures continuous liquidity and fair pricing
- **Share Trading**: Trade "Yes/No" outcome shares with automated pricing based on AMM algorithms
- **Decentralized Resolution**: Markets are resolved by verified moderators (not market creators to prevent conflicts)
- **STX-Based Betting**: All transactions use STX tokens with transparent fee distribution
- **Event Explorer**: Track market performance, volume, and outcomes
- **Auto-Expiration**: Markets automatically close and enter resolution phase
- **Slippage Protection**: Built-in mechanisms to protect traders from excessive price impact

## How It Works

1. **Create Market**: Users create prediction markets by specifying title, description, and duration
2. **Initial Liquidity**: Markets start with balanced liquidity pools using AMM algorithms
3. **Buy Shares**: Participants purchase "Yes" or "No" shares with prices determined by constant product formula
4. **Price Discovery**: Share prices adjust automatically based on supply/demand through AMM mechanics
5. **Resolution**: After market expiry, authorized resolvers determine the outcome
6. **Claim Winnings**: Winners can claim their proportional share of the total pool

## Advanced Pricing Models

### Constant Product AMM
- Uses the formula `x * y = k` where x and y are pool reserves and k is constant
- Provides continuous liquidity and automatic price adjustment
- Minimizes price manipulation through balanced pool mechanics

### Dynamic Pricing Features
- **Price Impact Calculation**: Shows how trades affect market prices
- **Slippage Tolerance**: Configurable limits to protect against unfavorable price movements
- **Minimum Liquidity**: Ensures markets maintain sufficient depth for fair trading
- **Fee Integration**: Platform fees are seamlessly integrated into AMM calculations
