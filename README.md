**On-Chain Prediction Markets Beyond the Known**

EventHorizon is a decentralized prediction market platform built on the Stacks blockchain where users can create and trade outcome shares for real-world events like elections, sports, and cryptocurrency prices.

## Features

- **Market Creation**: Anyone can create prediction markets with custom duration and resolution periods
- **Share Trading**: Trade "Yes/No" outcome shares with dynamic pricing based on pool liquidity
- **Decentralized Resolution**: Markets are resolved by verified moderators (not market creators to prevent conflicts)
- **STX-Based Betting**: All transactions use STX tokens with transparent fee distribution
- **Event Explorer**: Track market performance, volume, and outcomes
- **Auto-Expiration**: Markets automatically close and enter resolution phase

## How It Works

1. **Create Market**: Users create prediction markets by specifying title, description, and duration
2. **Buy Shares**: Participants purchase "Yes" or "No" shares based on their predictions
3. **Price Discovery**: Share prices adjust dynamically based on the pool ratios
4. **Resolution**: After market expiry, authorized resolvers determine the outcome
5. **Claim Winnings**: Winners can claim their proportional share of the total pool
