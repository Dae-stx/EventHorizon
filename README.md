# EventHorizon üåå

**Next-Generation Decentralized Prediction Markets with Oracle Integration**

EventHorizon is an advanced decentralized prediction market platform built on the Stacks blockchain, featuring sophisticated AMM algorithms, external oracle integration, and automated market resolution capabilities for real-world events.

## üöÄ Key Features

### Core Functionality
- **Market Creation**: Anyone can create prediction markets with custom parameters and oracle integration
- **Advanced AMM Pricing**: Sophisticated automated market maker using constant product formula (x * y = k)
- **Oracle Integration**: External oracle support for automated and verifiable market resolution
- **Dynamic Liquidity**: Continuous liquidity provision with balanced pool mechanics
- **Share Trading**: Trade "Yes/No" outcome shares with real-time AMM-based pricing
- **Decentralized Resolution**: Multiple resolution methods including oracle-based and community-driven

### Advanced Features
- **Oracle Management**: Comprehensive oracle registration, authorization, and data validation system
- **Auto-Resolution**: Markets can automatically resolve using external oracle data
- **Slippage Protection**: Built-in mechanisms with configurable tolerance levels
- **Price Impact Analysis**: Real-time calculation of trade impact on market prices
- **Multi-Resolution Support**: Both manual and oracle-based resolution methods
- **Enhanced Security**: Comprehensive input validation and principal verification

## üîß How It Works

### Market Creation & Trading Flow
1. **Market Setup**: Create markets with optional oracle integration for automated resolution
2. **Liquidity Provisioning**: Markets launch with balanced AMM pools using initial liquidity
3. **Oracle Configuration**: Link markets to external oracles for automated data feeds
4. **Share Trading**: Participants buy/sell shares with prices determined by AMM algorithms
5. **Price Discovery**: Continuous price adjustment based on supply/demand through AMM mechanics
6. **Resolution**: Automated oracle resolution or manual resolution by authorized parties
7. **Winnings Distribution**: Proportional payout based on winning shares and total pool

### Oracle Integration Workflow
1. **Oracle Registration**: Authorized operators register oracles with unique identifiers
2. **Data Updates**: Oracle operators provide real-world data with timestamp verification
3. **Market Linking**: Markets can be linked to specific oracles with resolution criteria
4. **Automated Resolution**: Markets resolve automatically when oracle criteria are met
5. **Data Validation**: Built-in validation ensures oracle data freshness and accuracy

## üßÆ Advanced AMM Architecture

### Constant Product Formula
```
x * y = k (where k remains constant)
```
- **x, y**: Reserve amounts for Yes/No pools
- **k**: Constant product maintained across all trades
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Prices adjust automatically based on pool ratios

### Enhanced AMM Features
- **Fee Integration**: Platform fees seamlessly integrated into AMM calculations
- **Slippage Calculation**: Real-time slippage impact analysis
- **Minimum Output**: Guaranteed minimum shares with configurable slippage tolerance
- **Price Impact Protection**: Prevents excessive market manipulation
- **Liquidity Constraints**: Minimum liquidity requirements for market stability

## üì° Oracle System

### Oracle Management
- **Registration**: Authorized oracle operators can register data providers
- **Authorization**: Contract owner controls oracle operator permissions
- **Data Validation**: Comprehensive validation of oracle data integrity and freshness
- **Multi-Oracle Support**: Support for multiple oracle providers per platform

### Oracle Data Structure
```clarity
{
  oracle-id: uint,
  data-key: string,
  value: string,
  timestamp: uint,
  block-height: uint,
  verified: bool
}
```

### Resolution Criteria
- **Automated Resolution**: Markets can resolve based on oracle data automatically
- **Data Freshness**: Oracle data must be within validity window (24 hours)
- **Verification Requirements**: Only verified oracle data can trigger resolutions
- **Fallback Resolution**: Manual resolution available if oracle fails
